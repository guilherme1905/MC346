-- First Lets learn about graphs in haskell

-- Our job is to make a program that takes input that represents a road system and print out what the shortest path across it is. Here's what the input would look like for this case:

  -- Road system input exampleâˆ·
    -- 50
    -- 10
    -- 30
    -- 5
    -- 90
    -- 20
    -- 40
    -- 2
    -- 25
    -- 10
    -- 8
    -- 0

    -- Read each section like: Road A, Road B, crossing road.
    -- To have it neatly fit into threes we say that there's a last crossing section that takes 0 minutes to drive.

    -- we're going to solve this problem in three steps:
      -- Forget Haskell for a minute and think about how we'd solve the problem by hand
      -- Think about how we're going to represent our data in Haskell
         -- One way is to think of the starting points and crossroads as nodes of a graph that point to other crossroads
         -- If we imagine that the starting points actually point to each other with a road that has a length of one, we see that every crossroads (or node) points to the node on the other side and also to the next one on its side. Except for the last nodes, they just point to the other side.

-- data Node = Node Road Road | EndNode Road
-- data Road = Road Int Node

      -- Figure out how to operate on that data in Haskell so that we produce at a solution


  -- matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
